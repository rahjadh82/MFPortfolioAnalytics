# MFPortfolioAnalytics
The project is to create utility functions to get the complete portfolio holdings data for your mutual funds.
The holdings data is retrieved using webscraping the MoneyControl site

To get data of your holdings, create a csv file in your local folder with the below details per line
 <name of the mutual fund>,<the link to MoneyControl site that has the holdings data>,value of your holding
 axis-bluechip-fund-direct-plan,https://www.moneycontrol.com/mutual-funds/axis-bluechip-fund-direct-plan/portfolio-holdings/MAA181,1000

How do I get the link?
You can get the link by visiting the moneycontrol site and search for the fund. Once you are on the fund page, click on the POrtfolio
tab, there you will see a link to "View complete holding", once you click on that you will be directed to a new URL, use that URL here
